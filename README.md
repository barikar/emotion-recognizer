# emotion-recognizer
This project detects and classifies human facial emotions in real-time using deep learning.
It uses **OpenCV** for face detection and **TensorFlow/Keras** for emotion classification.
Emotions recognized include: happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, disgusted, and neutral.
The detected emotion is also mapped to an appropriate **emoji** for intuitive feedback.
Built using a **CNN model** trained on the **FER2013 dataset**.
Compatible with standard webcams for live video feed input.
Applies to HCI, healthcare, education, marketing, security, and more.
Developed in **Python**, with additional libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, and emoji.
Offers potential for emotion-aware systems and affective computing.
